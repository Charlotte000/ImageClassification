# ImageClassification
Simple Python3 Tensorflow image classification that detects mug's on the image

# How to start  
Install __requirements.txt__  
Run __createModel.py__ to create tensorflow model  
Run __statistics.py__ to see _precision_, _recall_, and _f measure_ of created model   
Run:
```
python main.py path/to/my/file.jpg
```  
to make a prediction of your __file.jpg__  
Current staticsics are the following:  

| Precision | Recall | F measure |
| --------- | ------ | --------- |
| 0.8176    | 0.7031 | 0.756     |
